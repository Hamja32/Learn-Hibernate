dynamic schema generation

[hbm2ddl.auto] property

a) <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>

=>it will always create new db table based on the hibernate mapping file info supplied
=>if db table is already existing then it will delete the table and then it will create one new fresh database table
=> It internally uses schema export tool
=>if you are developing long running application withou shutdown restart, or once in a very long while there is chance to restart
the application then it is recommanded to go with 'create' option
eg - railway ticket booking apps may be vanished every 2,3 years


b) <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>

=>it internally uses SchemaUpdate tool
=>it creates the db table if the db table is not already available
=>if db table is already with the matching name of the table attribute of <class> tag in hibernate mapping file then it will not create 
another table and alters that table
=>This is the most used property


c) a) <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">validate</property>

=>it varifies whether db table is already exist or not according to the mapping file configuration
=>it will give exception - SchemaManagementException if there is no table or column related to the table as configured in mapping
file.
=> As a part of validation/varification it will check the db table,column availability,data type matching column count  etc
Note : The option does not attempt to create or alter table dynamically

d)  <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create-drop</property>

=> it internally uses schema export tool 
=> it creates db table based on mapping file info when sessionFactory object is created
and also the db table is deleted when sessionFactory is destroyed
=> This is very useful while testing projects, while giving demo to the project and also in UAT because in these practices we only
need data to be available temporary
