object getting from db using hibernate

1. session.get(-,-)		- depricated
=> it performs the eager loading of the object

eager loading : whether you use the object or not , get method will load the object. This is eager loading

2. session.load(-,-)
=> it can perform both eager or lazy loading of the object at once
by default - lazy loading

lazy loading : when you're using the object it will load 

=> All single row operations in hibernate takes place by taking identity value as critaria value
=> if you want to perform row operations in bulk you should go for HQL,NativeSQL, Critaria API

Imp : Dynamic select queries for session.load() and session.get() is not generated, also delete queries are not generated dynamically. They are pregenerated queries.

#working with session.load() method
--> default :  lazy loading

if lazy='true' (attribute) is used then it performs lazy loading
else it performs eager loading

Note : internally it uses proxy design pattern
2. load() method
load() method is used to retrieve an object from the database by its identifier (primary key). It is used to initialize a proxy object instead of a fully-initialized object, so it can be used to lazily load the object when it is needed.
load() method does not retrieve the object from the database when it is called. Instead, it returns a proxy object that represents the object. The actual object is only retrieved from the database when it is needed, such as when a method of the object is called or a property is accessed. This technique is known as "lazy loading" and it is used to improve the performance of Hibernate by avoiding unnecessary database queries.
load() method throws ObjectNotFoundException if there is no object found in the database
